These modules have been slightly expanded from CyberAces by the addition of a VLAN module.  The CyberPatriot competition requires some knowledge of VLANs.

These labs use Cisco equipment and software (PacketTracer), but the concepts a general and not specific to Cisco.  Since my classes compete in CyberPatriots, which use Cisco, we do as well.

## # Equipment or Virtual?

I prefer having at least some hardware labs, as I believe that students learn better when they can touch and plug in physical cables.  However, not every classroom has access to hardware so I've tried to accomodate both.  Most labs have both PacketTracer and hardware sections.  If you don't have hardware you could skip those parts.

### Equipment options
A classroom lab for 12-15 students using these these networking modules needs to have:
- 	4 switches.  The switches do not need to be enterprise switches with management.  You can buy cheap switches at Amazon or a big box store for about $20 each.
- 	~30 Cat 5 or 6 network cables of varying length.
- 	3 routers.  I prefer a Cisco 2911 router.  At least 2 of the routers should have 3 Ethernet ports; one router may have 2 Ethernet ports.  You can purchase these routers on Ebay for less than $100 each.

### Other equipment problems
If you use a classroom lab, you need to have the ability to wire the lab computers to your networking equipment.  For some classrooms, this will require a very cooperative IT person.  It is very important that you are careful to return the lab to its original condition when the lab is complete.  Cookies for the IT person may also help.

It helps to have some basic Cisco networking experience to teach the labs.  If you do not have that experience, many CTE programs have Cisco programs and may be able to help.  You are not competing with their Cisco certification programs; these modules are intended to provide a basic introduction to networking and not a path to certifications.


## Virtual
Cisco PacketTracer once was only available to members of the Cisco Networking Academy.  In the past, my classes gained access to the academy and PacketTracer through the CyberPatriots competition.  Now, the academy offers a free Introduction to PacketTracer course which includes a PacketTracer download.  https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer-
