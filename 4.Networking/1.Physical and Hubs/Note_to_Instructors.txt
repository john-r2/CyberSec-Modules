Note to instructors
You can buy hubs for $50 or less, but I'm not sure if it is worth the expense.  It is very difficult to find hubs these days--the majority of what you see on Amazon listed as hubs are actually switches.  Hubs are mostly useful for history lessons and certification questions these days, so you may want to skip this lab.  I still teach hubs for two reasons:  The lab makes what switches do more obvious, and the students have fun with netcat or ncat.

You can still do the lab in VMware if you don't have hubs.  When two or more VMs are running on the same host in VMware Workstation (or Player) VMware acts as if the VMs and the host are all connected together with a hub.  All VMs and the host hear all the traffic.

If you want to purchase a hub, you can get a new hub at the links below for about $50.
