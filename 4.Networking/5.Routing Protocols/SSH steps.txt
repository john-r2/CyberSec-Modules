hostname routerA  (or routerB or routerC)
! ssh needs the router to have a name other than the default, Router

enable secret svgs
! you can't get enable remotely unless there is a secret set

ip domain-name svgs.k12.va.us
! part of the router name, needed for the key

crypto key generate rsa 
! 
!The name for the keys will be: RemoteSiteRouter1.cisco.com
!Choose the size of the key modulus in the range of 360 to 2048 for your
!  General Purpose Keys. Choosing a key modulus greater than 512 may take
!  a few minutes.

!How many bits in the modulus [512]: you enter the following:
1024
!% Generating 1024 bit RSA keys, keys will be non-exportable...[OK]


! *Mar 1 0:14:19.855: %SSH-5-ENABLED: SSH 1.99 has been enabled
! once keys are made, router turns on SSH 1.99 (obsolete)

ip ssh version 2


username admin password svgs
! create the username and password to login via ssh

line vty 0 4
 login local
 transport input ssh


! line is like an interface, but it is used to control the router
! vty is virtual terminal, used for ssh and telnet
! line vty 0 4 configures vty numbers 0 through 4, so five users can log in
!   it could be line vty 0 15 to use all 16 terminals, but why bother?
! login local means use the user/password on the router that we just configured
! transport input ssh means only allow ssh, don't allow telnet
