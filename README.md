These files are a collection of Cyber Security labs for gifted high school students and community college students.  They started as additions to  the Cyber Aces modules created by SANS.  https://tutorials.cyberaces.org/tutorials.html.  The labs were developed for courses at Shenandoah Valley Governor's School, Fishersville, VA, and Blue Ridge Community College, Weyers Cave, VA.
