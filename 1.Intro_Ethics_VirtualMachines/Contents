Lab--Create Windows 10 VM.docx  Allow students to install Win 10 as a virtual machine so they can experiment without damaging the computer lab.  Note:  The lab refers to a classroom server where I store a copy of the Win 10 ISO to prevent us from hogging the school bandwidth.  When network storage for the computer lab is not available, I have copied the ISO to USB flash drives and loaned them to the students.

ISO boot.docx (Optional)  Reference material on how to create bootable flash drives using the Windows command prompt.
